This is a website to practice my html and css formatting. I am creating a poem portfolio website.
There will be a homepage with a biopic and description of the website and my inspiration.
I'll start off with 4 poems, yet to be decided, and will utilize the Goodkit theme on Bootstrap as inspo.

COOLOrs (PHX Suns inspired lol)

INSPO IDEAS:
